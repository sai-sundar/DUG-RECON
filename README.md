# DUG-RECON
Direct Image Reconstruction with Generative Convolutional Networks
Tomographic Medical Image Reconstruction involves the mapping from projection space data collected by detectors to images that can be analysed for diagnosis. This work is an attempt to use Deep Learning to entirely perform the task of Reconstruction. The code in this repo is associated to the article given below:

DUG-RECON: A Framework for Direct Image Reconstruction using Convolutional Generative Networks, DOI:https://doi.org/10.1109/TRPMS.2020.3033172

The DUG-RECON framework has a three stage training with Denoising, DUG and the SuperResnet block. The training methodology is explained in the paper and individual python files are present in this repo to train the different stages.

Requirements:
Python 3
Tensorflow 1.14
Keras 2.0
